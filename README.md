## Tasks for the Third Part
Implement the Keywords View: Create a new view, keywordsView(movieId), that displays the keywords of a selected movie. Include buttons to add each keyword to the user's custom list. The view should be visually clear and easy to use.
Process the Keywords: Implement the processKeywords(keywords) function to clean and organize the keywords before displaying them in the interface. This function should handle special characters appropriately and normalize the keywords.
Create a Custom Keyword List: Implement the addKeywordToList(keyword) functionality that allows users to add keywords to their custom list. Create the myKeywordsView() to display the custom list and allow keywords to be removed if necessary. This view should allow users to efficiently manage their list with ease.
Update the Router: Add the necessary new actions to the router to manage events related to keywords and the custom list. Ensure that all functionalities are well-integrated and accessible to the user.

## Summary of the Third Part
This third part of the exercise will provide students with the opportunity to work with textual data, apply regular expressions, and develop advanced text manipulation skills. Students will learn to analyze and process information obtained from an API and create a custom list that enhances the user experience. Additionally, they will gain a deeper understanding of how keywords and metadata can improve search and personalization in an application. By the end of this part of the exercise, students will have created an application that can extract, analyze, and personalize keywords associated with movies, thereby improving user interaction and personalization capabilities. This will result in a richer user experience tailored to individual interests, allowing users to interact more meaningfully with the available content.
